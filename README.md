# Chrome-Extension
Made my first chrome extension using html css and Javascript.

You can save all the important tabs you want to save and can visit whenever you want to use them just by clicking on the link.

You can give the tab link manually (save input button) or can directly fetch from the website you are currently using (save tab button)

Delete all the saved tabs/links by double clicking the delete all button
